## **Project Description**
This project is an educational clock game created for the purpose of improving children's clock telling abilities. Initial purpose to create an interactive visual understanding of analouge and digital times.
The clock game was created as an educational tool for children, as i have children of my own learning how to tell the time, so is to assit parents and potentially teachers, to provide an interactive game the is made for learning. 
The game was made so it is easy to use, access and understand for all from multiple devices and browsers. 
The game focuses on the difference between analogue and digital clocks being able to tell the difference in time, focusing predominately on ages 6 up. I do have plans to develop it further creating different levels and a varity of different options mixing between text and digits.
This project incoporates technology with education, its has been designed to be simple fun and engaging quick and easy with expected positive reactions after using it. 
With Technology being a huge part of society today, including the current pandemic children are often left to engage with technology, so the ability to use technology is getting younger, so being able to use this game from the age of 4 and maybe younge would be great.
I personally promote children learning through technology, being able to learn but have fun at the same time is crucial to a child's development and understanding/preparations for life.

### **_User Stories_**

- My child like to play games all the time, after school the first thing he grabs is the tablet and I would like if there were more games that was educational and fun.

- The pandemic has proved to be difficult for me as a working single mum, trying to work and educate my children at the same time as keeping them engaged. Having something fun and educational would be helpful to entertain them for a short while.

- Having an accessible game that is available in any enviroment would be advantagous.
